          <strong>Joe Biden</strong> won the support of black voters. Picking Klobuchar as his
          running mate could unravel that.
        </p>
        <p>
          The death of <strong>George Floyd</strong>, a black man who died after a Minneapolis
          police officer kneeled on his neck earlier this week, has
          resurrected Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s record as a prosecutor
          in the state ― including her tense relationship with the Black
          community there ― at the politically sensitive time that she’s being
          considered by Joe Biden to be his running mate.
        </p>
        <p>
          “There is absolutely no way that she is qualified to become Biden’s
          VP nominee,” said Nekima Levy Armstrong, a civil rights lawyer who
          served as head of the Minneapolis NAACP from 2015 to 2016.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Kenza Hadj-Moussa</strong>, a spokeswoman for the progressive group Take
          Action Minnesota said Klobuchar’s actions as a prosecutor “caused
          trauma that’s been long lasting.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “With everything that’s happened in Minneapolis and across the
          country,” she said, Klobuchar would put Biden at even more of a
          “disadvantage” politically.
        </p>
        <p>
          “This does not work in Amy’s favor because she had such a strained
          relationship with that community for years,” added a prominent
          Democrat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Four Minnesota police officers were fired this week after video
          emerged showing one of the men, a white officer, kneeling on Floyd’s
          neck as he pleaded for help, saying ”I can’t breathe.” They detained
          him Monday evening on suspicion of trying using a fake $20 bill at a
          convenience store. Floyd was declared dead shortly after arriving at
          the hospital.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two days of protests in Minneapolis have followed, with police using
          rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse crowds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Klobuchar received her start in politics right there, in Hennepin
          County, where she served as the top prosecutor for eight years,
          beginning in 1999. She employed a tough-on-crime approach, pushing,
          among other things, more convictions of minor offenses like graffiti
          and school truancy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Klobuchar’s methods were not exceptional for the time period, when
          cities were struggling to reduce the high crime rates of the 1980s
          and ’90s.
        </p>
        <p>
          But reformers now blame the techniques that she and others adopted
          for swelling the country’s disproportionately non-white jail and
          prison populations.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Minnesota leadership has really supported police and the expansion
          of policing,” said Isabela Escalona, a spokesperson for the Centro
          de Trabajadores Unidos en Lucha, a worker center that has fought
          against increases in Minneapolis’ police budget. “She’s a part of
          the problem and we must find community solutions to safety beyond
          police.”
        </p>
        <p>
          During her presidential campaign, Klobuchar faced deep skepticism
          from many Black voters, in part because of her record in Hennepin
          County. “As a prosecutor in heavily white Minnesota, Amy Klobuchar
          declined to go after police involved in fatal encounters with black
          men,” read the headline of a Washington Post article in March 2019
          that examined her record on criminal justice.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to The Washington Post,
        <blockquote cite="#"> Klobuchar chose not to bring
          charges against officers in more than two dozen cases where people
          were killed in police encounters.
        </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout her presidential campaign, and as recently as this week,
          Klobuchar has said she believes prosecutors — and not grand juries —
          should ultimately decide whether or not to charge police officers.
          In many of the cases cited in the Post, grand juries ultimately
          decided not to hand up charges.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I think it just makes for much more responsibility if you basically
          make the decision yourself,” she told CNN’s Chris Cuomo in an
          interview earlier this week. “Back then it was thought, let the
          community help decide how these cases should be handled.”
        </p>
        <p>
          As a presidential candidate, and before that as a Senate candidate,
          Klobuchar cited the prosecution of the alleged perpetrators of a
          2002 shooting that killed 11-year-old Tyesha Edwards as evidence
          that her prosecutorial style came in response to genuine concern
          from the state’s Black community about gun violence plaguing urban
          neighborhoods.
        </p>
        <p>
          But an investigation by The Associated Press in February found that
          there were many outstanding questions about the evidence that
          Klobuchar’s office used to convict Myon Burrell, who was 16 at the
          time of the shooting and is serving a life sentence. His
          co-defendants now deny that he participated in the shooting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Protesters angered by the case stormed the stage ahead of a planned
          rally in a Minneapolis suburb two nights before Super Tuesday in
          early March. The demonstration prompted Klobuchar to cancel the
          rally; she dropped out of the presidential race the next day.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Burrell case looms large for activists wary of Biden picking her
          as a running mate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Biden “uses all the language of [Black Lives Matter] and liberal
          racial justice advocates but you look at what a person does,” said a
          Minneapolis progressive strategist, who asked for anonymity to speak
          freely. “Picking Klobuchar, given the record she has, especially in
          this moment, seems like nothing less than an admission that he
          doesn’t seriously care about these issues.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “The Black community in Minnesota has consistently expressed concern
          about Amy Klobuchar’s prosecutorial record and her involvement in
          prosecuting Myon Burrell, an innocent Black teenager whose case was
          used by her for political gain, including during her campaign for
          President,” Levy Armstrong said. “Another deeply troubling aspect of
          Klobuchar’s record was her failure to hold a single officer
          accountable for police shootings, dozens of which happened on her
          watch.”

          called for an independent investigation into Burrell’s case, a move
          that drew praise from an attorney for the Burrell family and Leslie
          Redmond, the head of the Minneapolis NAACP who has protested
          Klobuchar in the past.
        </p>
        <p>
          Klobuchar’s office declined to comment on the record for this story.
        </p>
        <p>
          Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who is Black and a former
          criminal defense attorney, defended Klobuchar’s prosecutorial
          record, maintaining that she was “not unusually tough” and has since
          become a “voice for criminal justice reform in the context of race.”
        </p>

          Derek Chauvin, the police officer seen kneeling on Floyd, had
          previously been involved in two other violent incidents with
          civilians. One happened in late October 2006, when he and five other
          officers shot and killed a man who they said aimed a shotgun at
          them. Only days later, Klobuchar was elected to the Senate and
          remained Hennepin County district attorney for two more months. In
          October 2007, ten months after Klobuchar joined the Senate, a grand
          jury declined to bring charges against Chauvin and the other
          officers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Klobuchar put out a statement on Floyd’s death, describing it as a
          ”horrifying and gut wrenching instance of an African-American man
          dying.” She also called for a “complete and thorough outside
          investigation into what occurred, and those involved must be held
          accountable.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Her office did not return a request for comment for this piece.
          Biden has publicly said he is going to choose a woman as his running
          mate and that Klobuchar is someone he is considering. But he has
          also been under significant pressure to choose a woman of color.
        </p>
        <p>
          Biden’s campaign looked like it was over, until South Carolina
          voters ― primarily, Black voters in the state ― delivered him a
          knock-out victory. In recognition of that support, many Democrats
          have urged him to choose a woman of color ― or, at the very least,
          not to pick someone who has had such a strained relationship with
          the Black community.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a recent Washington Post op-ed, a group of six Black female
          activists specifically named Klobuchar as an unacceptable vice
          presidential option if he wants to win over Black voters: “Biden,
          the presumptive Democratic nominee, does not need help winning
          white, working-class voters — he serves that function himself. A
          choice such as [Klobuchar], who failed to prosecute controversial
          police killings and is responsible for the imprisonment of Myon
          Burrell, will only alienate black voters.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Last week, Biden made supporters cringe when he told Charlamagne tha
          God, a popular Black radio host, “If you have a problem figuring out
          whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t Black.” He apologized
          later that day in a call with Black business leaders, saying he was
          “too cavalier” and did not take the Black vote for granted.
        </p>
        <p>
          The prominent Democrat who spoke with HuffPost said the comments
          underscored why Biden needed to choose a woman of color ― or someone
          who can help him talk to voters of color.
        </p>
        <p>
          “There are a couple of things that I think are going to hurt her,”
          they said of Klobuchar. “One was Biden’s real big gaffe, which now I
          think forces his hand in more ways than one to pick a woman of
          color. But two, now this [Floyd killing] is going to raise all the
          issues, particularly with the Minneapolis NAACP and the
          African-American community. It’s going to dredge all that back up
          again.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Ellison, who supported Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ presidential
          run, said he does not think Biden should be limited to choosing a
          woman of color as his running mate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Klobuchar would “make a great vice president. She’d be a tireless
          campaigner too,” he said. “She’ll help us win the upper Midwest.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Biden released a statement on Floyd on Wednesday, saying it was “not
          an isolated incident, but a part of an ingrained systemic cycle of
          justice that still exists in this country.” The former vice
          president is set to deliver a keynote at the Minnesota
          Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party’s state convention on Sunday,
          introduced by Klobuchar. His team has not yet released his remarks,
          but some allies have urged him to address Floyd’s death.
        </p>
        <p>
          Biden has enjoyed high support among older Black voters, but has
          struggled with young voters of all races, who typically have more
          progressive views on a host of issues. Hillary Clinton’s failure to
          generate higher turnout among Black voters in general, and young
          Black voters in particular, is widely considered a key reason for
          her loss to Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential race.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those younger voters are looking for a vice presidential pick who
          demonstrates that Biden is committed to a world with fewer deaths
          like George Floyd’s, according to Hadj-Moussa. “There’s an
          incredible amount of pain and we have an opportunity to not go back
          to the way things were, but to create a better future,” she said.
          “If I was advising Vice President Biden, I would not point to Sen.
          Klobuchar as a vice presidential pick who could stand next to him
          and be part of building a new future.” Kevin Robillard contributed
          reporting.
