            <strong>Chris Hayes</strong> on Thursday took Donald Trump’s 2016
            campaign claims and lobbed them right back at the president,
            lamenting “the carnage and chaos we are living through now.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The host of MSNBC’s “All In” pointed out that Trump had essentially
            campaigned on the idea that the United States was a “hellhole” and
            later promised to “stop the American carnage” during his 2017
            inauguration address.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hayes acknowledged that the United States had its fair share of
            problems before Trump became president. But Trump, he argued, has
            only made things worse, especially during the coronavirus pandemic.
          </p>
          <p>
            “There is no plan from the president, who warned against American
            carnage, with the carnage and chaos we are living through now,”
            Hayes said.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Not the pandemic. Not the economic crisis. Not the societal
            inequities. Not predatory policing. Not the protests in Minnesota,”
            he continued. “Nothing except to make it all worse, to sell chaos
            and discord and bigotry and hope the smaller part of the country
            that follows him is enough to win an election again.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “This is what <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> America has wrought,”
            he said.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chris Hayes on Friday dropped some truth bombs on President Donald
            Trump, his supporters and the right-wingers who continue to pour
            scorn on wearing face masks that aim to slow the spread of the
            coronavirus.
          </p>
          <p>
            The host of MSNBC’s “All In” noted how “not wearing a mask has kind
            of become a sort of weird, culture war virtue signaling by Trump
            people.” Trump himself has not worn a mask during recent briefings
            and tours of factories. GOP lawmakers and anti-lockdown protesters
            have also failed to wear them.
          </p>
          <p>
            But, Hayes explained, the anti-mask brigade (who he noted are “very
            much in the minority”) in fact appear to be obliviously working
            against their stated desire to ease lockdown restrictions and reopen
            the country.
          </p>
          <p>
            He spelled out why there is “nothing stupider” they can do:
          </p>
          <p>
            But for Donald Trump’s own stated aims, for the stated aims of those
            protesters, and all the right-wingers out there who think they’re
            the ones, the vanguard of opening up America and getting American
            capitalism cracking again, there is nothing stupider, nothing more
            counterproductive you can do than turn not wearing a mask into some
            right-wing badge of honor. “The mask is your friend,” Hayes
            continued. “If the stated goal here is to open up the American
            economy and get people back to work and achieve some level of
            normalcy, something we all desperately want, there is really good
            evidence that everyone wearing a mask can really help us in that
            project.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Hayes acknowledged he doesn’t like wearing a mask because it fogs up
            his glasses and makes him feel claustrophobic.
          </p>
          <p>
            But he does it for the bigger picture, he said. “We are facing a
            pandemic that has ravaged everyone’s life,” Hayes concluded. “The
            easiest, lowest-hanging fruit to make things at least somewhat
            better, the smallest, most trivial thing is: Let’s all wear masks.”
          </p>
          <p>
            On its website, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
            recommends “wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where
            other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain” and
            “especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.”
          </p>
          <p>
            More than 88,000 people in the U.S. have now died from COVID-19, the
            disease caused by the virus. CDC Director
            <strong>Dr. Robert Redfield</strong> said Friday that the nationwide
            death toll could hit 100,000 by June 1.
          </p>
          <p>
            Trump, meanwhile, continues to push for the reopening of the
            country, despite case numbers still rising and against the advice of
            public health officials.
