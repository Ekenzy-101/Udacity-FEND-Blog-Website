          Many people assume that as JavaScript has “Java” in its name they
          both are somehow related. While many coders groan at this coupling
          and many even feel that this naming confusion is just a part of a
          marketing gimmick, the history of these two popular programming
          languages did intersect for a very brief moment in time during the
          early days of Netscape.
        </p>
        <p>
          The evolution of the two programming languages took such different
          paths from that point forward that there is a common joke that Java
          is to JavaScript as ham is to a hamster. But if you are reading this
          article, you are probably interested in a more useful explanation of
          these two popular languages, so let me compare the two. If we
          travelled back in time for about 5 years, there would be a simple
          comparison like Java is a general-purpose coding language, and
          JavaScript is used on the web applications to make them interactive
          and animated. Now that JS has “grown-up,” the comparison is much
          more complicated here.
        </p>
        <p>
          First of all, have a look at some interesting facts and stats about
          Java and JavaScript:
        </p>
        <p>
          The primary name of Java was “Oak” and it was changed to Java by the
          marketing department of Sun’s to “Java” when they already found that
          name was registered for some computer company.
        </p>
        <p>
          Java programming language was created by an accident. Around 1992,
          James Gosling was working at the Sun Labs. He along with his team
          was building a set-top box and which was started by “cleaning up”
          the C++ language and they all wound up with a new programming
          language called Java or at that time: Oak. Java is the second most
          popular programming language and is very popular among web
          developers. Java programming language is free from the concept of
          Pointer as adding pointers to the Java programming language would
          compromise security and robustness, making this programming language
          even more complex.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Java, the actual meaning of the Final keyword is not final. It
          has different meanings in Java. It can be the Final method, Final
          class, Final variable or Final field. Nowadays, Java is used by 95
          percent of the enterprises as their primary programming language. It
          is much more than C and other programming languages. In a single
          year, Java gets downloaded for about one billion times. Today, Java
          runs on over 1 billion as Google’s Android operating system uses
          Java APIs.
        </p>
        <h4>A Small Introduction</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>JavaScript</strong>
          In the early days of the Internet, around 1990, Internet Explorer
          and Netscape Navigator were the two most popular web browsers used
          by the general public. In just 10 days, a developer named Brendan
          Eich at Netscape, Inc. was able to create a programming language
          that could instruct a computer to interact with the user upon
          receiving user input. He called this language “LiveScript” and
          integrated it directly into the navigator.
        </p>
        <p>
          This meant that the browser was literally interpreting the user’s
          commands; The code did not have to be compiled, and plug-ins were
          not required. Another programming language, Java, was gaining
          popularity around the same time, even though Java required a
          separate plug-in for the function. Netscape saw the opportunity and
          named its language “JavaScript”. JavaScript was unavoidable in the
          early days of the Internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Java</strong>
        <blockquote cite="#">Java is a programming language invented by James Gosling and
          developed by Sun Microsystems.</blockquote> It took a little over 10 days to
        develop — it was close to four years old. In 1991, a group of Sun
        Microsystem engineers worked the “Green Team” day and night to
        create Java. It was first released in 1995, and many new versions
        have been launched since then. Today’s Internet is absolutely
        saturated with Java-based programming, and we have Java to thank for
        the many applications that make day-to-day life easier. Java is
        currently owned by Oracle. Let us see some of their differences as
        well as similarities from a web app development perspective:
        </p>
        <h4>Major Similarities</h4>
        <p>
          As they separate, there are some top-level similarities, which are
          worth considering, especially if you are looking at web app
          development when comparing Java to JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Object-Oriented Programming(OOP).</strong>
          Both languages ​​require the developer to code objects and their
          relationships in the context of each other. By extension, it gives
          both languages ​​access to technologies such as inheritance,
          encapsulation, and polymorphism.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Front-end development.</strong>
          Both languages ​​can be used in aspects of front-end development.
          JavaScript can be embedded directly into HTML, which is implemented
          as a framework or library; Java can be used as a Java applet.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Back-end development.</strong>
          Both languages ​​can be used on the server-side. Java has long been
          used to power back-end technologies such as Apache, JBoss, and
          WebSphere. Node.js has become a launchpad for JavaScript-powered
          servers.
