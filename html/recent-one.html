          <strong>Jadon Sancho</strong> has been struggling for fitness after returning from
          injury, and his Dortmund team-mate Erling Haaland appeared to
          endorse a tweet pointing this out Erling Haaland appeared to take a
          swipe at his Dortmund team-mate Jadon Sancho's fitness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Haaland isn't as vocal on Twitter as some footballers, but his
          account 'liked' a tweet reading: "<em>Sancho does not look match fit at
            the moment</em>".
        </p>
        <p>
          It's not clear whether the Norwegian forward did so by mistake, as
          Haaland's account later 'unliked' the tweet. But not before it was
          spotted by his followers, who shared it on the social media site.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sancho has recently returned from injury and has been struggling for
          fitness as the Bundesliga has got back underway.
        </p>
        <p>
          The England international has not been picked to start in any of
          Dortmund's three fixtures this month against Schalke, Wolsfburg and
          Bayern Munich.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sancho's Dortmund team-mate <strong>Thomas Delaney</strong> recently spoke out about
          his team-mate, and revealed the pressure he is under to achieve.
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em>Clearly, one of the biggest talents that I've played with,</em>" Delaney
          told ESPN.
        <blockquote cite="#">
          "With that talent comes a lot of pressure and I think he
          slowly starts to feel that from the England national team and clubs
          surrounding him now.
        </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
          "Up until this point he's been a talent performing very well,
          performing better than what he is expected to do but there was
          always going to be a next step and that's going to be interesting.
          Next step in his career and his development.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Only looking at his skills, he definitely has what it takes to
          become one of the five biggest players in the world. You see big
          talents go to waste and I would say that he's already done enough to
          prove himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          "He's 19 and he's got the most goal involvement in the league
          together with <strong>Timo Werner</strong> and <strong>Robert Lewandowski</strong> which is amazing
          but he should strive for more."
